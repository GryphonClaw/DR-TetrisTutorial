This is the tetris tutorial for DragonRuby made by Ryan C. Gordon on YouTube

Part 1: [DragonRuby Tetris Tutorial Part 1][tutorial_part1]
Part 2: [DragonRuby Tetris Tutorial Part 2][tutorial_part2]

Though with very little modification, this is basically exactly what Mr. Gordon wrote in the tutorial.
I added items as hashes instead of arrays and renamed a couple of local variables.
